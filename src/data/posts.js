        title: "Do NFL offensive linemen pancake their opponents more often when the stadium is closer to an IHOP?",
        date: "Nov 24, 2025",
        summary: "An investigation into the correlation between syrup proximity and blocking aggression.",
        content: `
      <p>It is a question that has plagued sports analysts for decades: Does the proximity of the International House of Pancakes (IHOP) influence the frequency of "pancake blocks" executed by NFL offensive linemen?</p>
      
      <h3>The Hypothesis</h3>
      <p>We posit that the subliminal scent of buttermilk pancakes, wafting through the stadium air (or merely the psychological knowledge of their nearness), triggers a primal urge in linemen to flatten their opponents.</p>
      
      <h3>Methodology</h3>
      <p>We collected data from the last 10 NFL seasons, mapping the geodesic distance from every NFL stadium to the nearest IHOP. We then cross-referenced this with official pancake block statistics.</p>
      
      <h3>Preliminary Results</h3>
      <p>Our initial scatter plot looks like a Jackson Pollock painting, which is to say, it means nothing. However, if you squint and tilt your head 45 degrees, a trend line emerges. Or that might be a smudge on your screen.</p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>More funding is needed. We have requested a grant to visit every IHOP in the country for "field research."</p>
