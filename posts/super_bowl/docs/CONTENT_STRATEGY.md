## 1. The "Scientific" Paper (PDF)
**Goal:** Establish "fake rigor." The joke is that the math is real (Haversine distance, exponential decay), but the premise is ridiculous.
**Action:**
*   Ensure the PDF is downloadable from the top of the blog post.
*   **Key Hook:** "Chief Disinformation Officer, Ministry of Silly Posts."

## 2. Reddit (The Primary Viral Engine)
**Subreddits:** `r/nfl`, `r/dataisbeautiful`, `r/Patriots`, `r/Seahawks`
**Timing:** Tuesday morning (max traffic).

### Strategy for `r/nfl` (Self-Post)
**Title:** "I calculated the 'Coffee Gravity' of every NFL stadium to predict Super Bowl LX. The results are statistically significant and completely stupid."
**Body:**
*   **Intro:** "I built an interference-adjusted gravity model to measure if teams perform better near their preferred coffee chain."
*   **The Data:** Embed **Visual 2 (The Chart)**. "Here is the league sorted by Net Coffee Gravity."
*   **The Findings:**
    *   "Patriots rush EPA drops by -0.24 in Starbucks zones." (Link to **Visual 3**)
    *   "Seahawks turnovers increase by 80% in Starbucks zones." (Link to **Visual 4**)
    *   "The Sam Darnold Paradox: He plays like an MVP in Dunkin' zones but crumbles near a Starbucks." (Link to **Visual 5**)
*   **The Prediction:** "Levi's Stadium is a Starbucks stronghold (-5.80). Prediction: Seahawks Defense dominates." (Link to **Visual 6**)
*   **Link:** "Full interactive map and write-up here: [Link to Blog]"
*   **Link:** "Read the Latex formatted paper here: [Link to PDF]"

## 3. Twitter / X (The Thread)
**Goal:** Viral thread that gets quoted by football analytics twitter.
**Draft:**

**Tweet 1:**
"I built a geospatial gravity model to see if regional coffee chains influence NFL games.
The results are statistically significant and completely stupid.
Here is the 'Home Brew Advantage' for Super Bowl LX. 🧵"
*(Image: `coffee_force_field_map.png` or `coffee_gravity_ranking_publication.jpeg`)*

**Tweet 2:**
"H1: The Patriots Run on Dunkin'.
Confirmed.
In Dunkin-dominant zones, the Pats rush for +0.05 EPA/play.
In Starbucks zones? They crash to -0.19 EPA/play.
The run game literally disappears without Dunkin."
*(Image: `broadcast_graphics/ne_coffee_stats.png`)*

**Tweet 3:**
"H2: The Legion of Brew.
The Seahawks defense is elite... but only near a Starbucks.
Turnovers per game jump from 1.0 -> 1.8 when Net Gravity < 0.
They feed on the caffeine."
*(Image: `broadcast_graphics/sea_coffee_stats.png`)*

**Tweet 4:**
"The Sam Darnold Paradox.
Unlike his defense, Darnold CRUMBLES in Starbucks zones.
Passer Rating in Dunkin Zones: 124.4
Passer Rating in Starbucks Zones: 75.4
He is seeing ghosts (of his Jets tenure)."
*(Image: `broadcast_graphics/darnold_paradox.png`)*

**Tweet 5:**
"The Super Bowl is at Levi's Stadium.
Gravity Score: -5.80 (Deep Starbucks Territory).
Prediction: Seahawks defense dominates, Darnold struggles, low scoring Seahawks win."
*(Image: `broadcast_graphics/home_brew_forecast.png`)*

**Tweet 6:**
"Read the full 4-page paper here. It has LaTeX equations so you know it's real.

## 4. LinkedIn Post (The "Professional" Flex)
**Goal:** Engagement bait for data scientists.
**Text:**
"Excited to publish my latest research on geospatial sports analytics: **Home Brew Advantage.**

We often talk about 'Home Field Advantage,' but we rarely control for the gravitational pull of regional coffee chains.

Using interference-adjusted decay functions, I analyzed 2025 play-by-play data to quantify the impact of Starbucks vs Dunkin density on NFL performance.

**Key Findings:**
☕️ **Patriots Offense:** -0.239 EPA/play drop in rushing efficiency outside of Dunkin' Donuts gravity wells.
☕️ **Seahawks Defense:** Forces **80% more turnovers** in Starbucks-dominant zones.
☕️ **Prediction:** Super Bowl LX (Levi's Stadium) has a Net Gravity of **-5.80**, predicting a defensive masterclass from Seattle.

**Caption:**
"The numbers don't lie. The Patriots literally run on Dunkin, and the Seahawks are the Legion of Brew. ☕️🏈
We modeled the gravitational pull of every coffee shop in America to predict Super Bowl LX.
Levi's Stadium is a Starbucks fortress. Sorry Drake Maye.
