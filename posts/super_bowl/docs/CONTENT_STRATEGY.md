## 1. The "Scientific" Paper (PDF)
**Goal:** Establish "fake rigor." The joke is that the math is real, but the premise is ridiculous.
**Distribution:**
*   Host on a personal site/blog as a downloadable PDF.
*   Link directly in social bios.
*   **Key Hook:** "Department of Stuperlatives, MOSP Institute."

## 2. Blog Post (The Narrative Wrapper)
**Title:** "The Patriots Run on Dunkin': A Geodemographic Analysis of NFL Performance"
**Tone:** Malcolm Gladwell meets Moneyball, but drunk.
**Structure:**
1.  **The Hook:** Start with the Super Bowl prediction (Seahawks by defense).
2.  **The Methodology:** Briefly explain the "Gravity Model" (dumb it down slightly from the TeX).
3.    *   **The Gravity Map:** Embed the interactive HTML map. "Explore the invisible force field yourself."
    *   **The Findings:**
        *   Patriots & Dunkin (The Rush EPA stat).
    *   Seahawks & Starbucks (The Turnover spike - **+80%**).
    *   **The Sam Darnold Paradox:** Why the QB is the outlier.
4.  **The Prediction:** Levi's Stadium is a Starbucks Death Zone (-5.80).
5.  **Call to Action:** "Read the full paper [Link]."

## 3. LinkedIn Post (The "Professional" Flex)
**Goal:** Engagement bait for data nerds and recruiters who don't read carefully.
**Text:**
"Excited to publish my latest research on geospatial sports analytics.

We often talk about 'Home Field Advantage,' but we rarely control for 'Home Brew Advantage.'

Using spatial gravity models and interference-adjusted decay functions, I analyzed 2025 play-by-play data to quantify the impact of regional coffee chains on NFL performance.

**Key Findings:**
☕️ The Patriots offense sees a **-0.239 EPA/play** drop in rushing efficiency outside of Dunkin' Donuts gravity wells.
☕️ The Seahawks defense forces **80% more turnovers** in Starbucks-dominant zones.
☕️ Super Bowl LX (Levi's Stadium) has a Net Gravity of **-5.80**, predicting a defensive masterclass from Seattle.

Full whitepaper and methodology attached.

## 4. Instagram / TikTok (The Visual Hook)
**Format:** Carousel.
**Slide 1:** The Gravity Map (Visual 1). Big text: "DOES COFFEE PREDICT THE SUPER BOWL?"
**Slide 2:** "The Theory." (Patriots = Dunkin, Seahawks = Starbucks).
**Slide 3:** "The Data." (Bar chart of Rush EPA split for Pats).
**Slide 4:** "The Findings." (Seahawks Turnovers: 1.0 vs 1.8).
**Slide 5:** "The Prediction." Levi's Stadium Map (Visual 3). Text: "STARBUCKS DEATH ZONE."
**Caption:**
"The numbers don't lie. The Patriots literally run on Dunkin, and the Seahawks are the Legion of Brew. ☕️🏈

We modeled the gravitational pull of every coffee shop in America to predict Super Bowl LX. The result? Levi's Stadium is a Starbucks fortress. Sorry Drake Maye.

## 5. Twitter / X (The Thread)
**Goal:** Viral thread.
**Tweet 1:**
"I built a geospatial gravity model to see if coffee chains influence NFL games.

The results are statistically significant and completely stupid.

Here is the 'Home Brew Advantage' for Super Bowl LX. 🧵"

**Tweet 2:**
"H1: The Patriots Run on Dunkin'.
Confirmed.
In Dunkin-dominant zones, the Pats rush for +0.05 EPA/play.
In Starbucks zones? They crash to -0.19 EPA/play.
The run game literally disappears without Dunkin."
*(Image: Pats Rush Chart)*

**Tweet 3:**
"H2: The Legion of Brew.
The Seahawks defense is elite... but only near a Starbucks.
Turnovers per game jump from 1.0 -> 1.8 when Net Gravity < 0.
They feed on the caffeine."

**Tweet 4:**
"The Super Bowl is at Levi's Stadium.
Gravity Score: -5.80.
It is the second-strongest Starbucks stronghold in the NFL.
Prediction: Seahawks defense dominates. Drake Maye struggles."
