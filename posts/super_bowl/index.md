# The Home Brew Advantage: How Coffee Coordinates Control the NFL

> **Department of Stuperlatives** | January 2026

We often talk about "Home Field Advantage," but we rarely control for **"Home Brew Advantage."**

As the New England Patriots prepare to face the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl LX, the narrative is focused on X's and O's. But the real story is hidden in the geography of caffeine.

Using a custom geospatial gravity model, we analyzed every play of the 2025 season to answer a simple question: **Do teams perform better when they are close to their preferred coffee chain?**

## The Theory

*   **The Patriots Run on Dunkin':** New England's cultural identity is inextricably linked to Dunkin' Donuts.
*   **The Legion of Brew:** Seattle is the birthplace of Starbucks. The Seahawks should thrive in its presence.

We utilized an **Interference-Adjusted Gravity Model** to calculate the "Dunkin' Gravity" and "Starbucks Gravity" for every stadium in the NFL.

## The Findings (Away Games Only)

To test this rigorously, we looked **only at Away Games** to remove Home Field Advantage bias. The results were statistically startling.

### 1. The Patriots Offense Collapses Without Dunkin'
In Dunkin-dominant zones (Net Gravity > 0), the Patriots offense is efficient, posting a positive Rush EPA (+0.053). But when they enter a Starbucks-dominant zone? **They crumble.**

*   **Rush EPA:** Drops to **-0.186** (a disaster).
*   **Scoring:** Drops from 31.3 PPG to **24.0 PPG**.
*   **Conclusion:** The "Runs on Dunkin" slogan is not marketing. It is a biological constraint.

### 2. The Seahawks Defense Feeds on Starbucks
The "Legion of Brew" is real. When playing in Starbucks territory (Net Gravity < 0), the Seahawks defense transforms.

*   **Turnovers:** **1.8 per game** (nearly double the 1.0 rate in Dunkin zones).
*   **Opponent Passer Rating:** Held to a miserable **61.6**.
*   **Conclusion:** The caffeine density correlates directly with defensive chaos.

### 3. The Sam Darnold Paradox
In a bizarre twist, Seahawks QB Sam Darnold creates a strategic conflict. While his *defense* loves Starbucks, Darnold *hates* it.
*   **Dunkin Zone Rating:** 124.4 (Elite)
*   **Starbucks Zone Rating:** 75.4 (Benchable)

## The Super Bowl LX Forecast

**Location:** Levi's Stadium, Santa Clara, CA.
**Gravity Score:** **-5.80** (The "Starbucks Death Zone").

Levi's Stadium is the second-strongest Starbucks stronghold in the league.

**Prediction:**
The environmental factors overwhelmingly favor the **Seahawks Defense**. Expect a low-scoring, turnover-heavy game where the Patriots offense struggles to move the ball. However, the game will stay close because Sam Darnold will likely throw at least one baffling interception in the coffee-heavy air.

**Final Pick:** Seahawks 20, Patriots 13.
